# lalettan-or-mammukka

This software is developed as a part of my online coure on Mechine Learning through FOSS conducted by ICFOSS.
This project's aim was to study sound based mechine learning thniques. Here I tried to classify two legend malayalam film actor's (Mammutty and Mohanlam) voices. You can drag and drop sound or video clips (below 150Mb size) of any of these actors talking, the sofware will analise and identifies the actor and shows the name and photograph.
